'''
First assignment for the CMEPDA course, 2022/23.
--- Goal
Write a Python program that prints the relative frequence of each letter
of the alphabet (without distinguishing between lower and upper case) in the
book.

--- Specifications
 - the program should have a --help option summarizing the usage
 - the program should accept the path to the input file from the command line
 - the program should print out the total elapsed time
 - the program should have an option to display a histogram of the frequences
 - [optional] the program should have an option to print out the basic book
   stats (e.g., number of characters, number of words, number of lines, etc.)
